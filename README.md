# parkrun-stats
A simple app for fetching stats from a parkrun event.

## Usage
1. Deploy to Heroku
3. Open the page with stats of the parkrun events. For example https://www.parkrun.pl/wzniesienieosowy/results/latestresults/
4. Save page as HTML
5. Open app in browser
6. Upload the HTML file
7. Enjoy the stats

The app is currently in polish only, but if anyone is interested in using it in other languages, I can add support for that.

Have fun, we'll se on Saturday at 9:00 AM! )
